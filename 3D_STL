These are the STL's that I created to house the tester.

My Chiron firmware I modified allows me to do colour changes in the same layer (manually). If you don't have a colour
capable printer, use the PLAIN stl. If you have a colour capable printer, use the FACE and WORDS at the same time. I
used PRUSA slicer to do it for me. No idea how it would be done in CURA, only used it for 5 minutes once.
